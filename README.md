Glitch on Dev.to
=================

This is a guide for writing blog posts for the [Glitch org on Dev.to](https://dev.to/glitch/). Testing. 

## Content on Dev.to
Basic standards:
- short (150-750 words)
- for a developer audience
- mention Glitch

Some potential topics include<sub>1</sub>:
- tutorials
- introductory articles
- roundups
- observations/trends
- editorials
- lessons learned
- annoucements/new features

Ideas<sub>1</sub>: 
- Have you ever found a workaround for a common barrier or issue in a piece of open-source software you use? 
- How do you use Glitch?
- New Glitch features
- If you had to make a choice about a tool or framework recently, how did you decide?

## Team
- Editor: Melissa McEwen
- Copyeditors: Ryan Khosravi
- Advisor: Margarita Noriega
- Tech reviewers: various members of the engineering team as needed

## Writing your post

### Proposal
Create a Clubhouse story using the Dev.to template. Assign to the editor. We'll work with you on topic and due date. 

### Outline
If you already have a process that works for you, go for it! Otherwise I strongly recommend writing a post outline and submitting it to Melissa for review. You can do this on the Clubhouse story. 

### Drafting
You're welcome to use whatever tools work for you. I strongly recommend using a tool like [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/), which encourages concise engaging writing. Make sure you follow the checklist in the Appendix. 

Drafts should be submitted as Markdown via PR at [devto-posts](https://github.com/glitchdotcom/devto-posts). At this point don't worry about embeds, pictures or any other formatting.

After your draft is ready:
- add a comment to the Clubhouse card with a link to your draft
- assign to Melissa

### Feedback
For the feedback process we'll give you big picture pointers on the structure and content of your piece. We will not directly edit your piece at this stage. After preparing feedback the editor will reassign the story to you. When you incorporate the feedback, please reassign to the editor for review. 


#### Technical Review 
The editor may add an additional reviewer for highly technical subjects if they are outside their experitise.

### Copyediting
At this stage, put your post into Dev.to and add any formatting and code blocks you'd like. Assign back to the editor. 

We'll make minor copy edits (spelling, grammar, formatting etc) directly, add UTM params to your links, and add images if you haven't. 


### Ready to post!
Next we'll workshop Tweets and social media images. Feel free to leave this to us. When we publish we'll promote on our Dev Twitter and the homepage. 



## Appendix
### Joining the Dev.to Glitch org 
TBD
### Writing checklist
- Introduction
  - a clear "what's this post about" sentence that tells the reader what they'll learn if they read on. 
  - a link to Glitch
  - keep it short!
- Subheaders (H2s)
  - if it's a tutorial, these should be the steps, otherwise these should be the main points
  - first sentence under subhead should introduce the section
  - we love links, make sure to link whenever possible
  - no sub subheads (like h3s, h4s)
- Conclusion
 - A CTA (call to action) sentence like "remix this and tweet us what you made"
 - Glitch boilerplate (see section in appendix)
 
 ### Glitch boilerplate
