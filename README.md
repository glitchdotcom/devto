Glitch on Dev.to
=================

We'd love to have you post on the [Glitch org on Dev.to](https://dev.to/glitch/). To create some consistency around posts we've created this handy guide. 

## Content on Dev.to
Basic standards:
- short (150-750 words)
- for a developer audience
- mention Glitch

Some potential topics include<sub>1</sub>:
- tutorials
- introductory articles
- roundups
- observations/trends
- editorials
- lessons learned
- annoucements/new features

Ideas<sub>1</sub>: 
- Have you ever found a workaround for a common barrier or issue in a piece of open-source software you use? 
- How do you use Glitch?
- New Glitch features
- If you had to make a choice about a tool or framework recently, how did you decide?

## Writing your post

### Drafting
You're welcome to use whatever tools work for you. I strongly recommend using a tool like [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) or [Vale](https://errata.ai/vale-server/), which can catch basic errors. See Writing Tips and Publishing Checklist in the Appendix.

### Getting Feedback
The post should be proofread by someone other than you. It can be anyone at Glitch and if you can't think of anyone post in the #editorial slack channel and someone will help you out. 

Share your post as a dev.to draft link OR if you want revisioning you can use one of these tools: 

- [A PR in the DevTo posts Github](https://github.com/glitchdotcom/devto-posts)
- [DraftIn](https://draftin.com/) 

though you'll have to copy and paste the results back and forth to Dev.to. 


### Publishing
Once you've gotten feedback and made the edits, post the final draft in the #editorial Slack channel. If there is no objection after a day, go ahead and add a card to [Shared Content Calendar](https://trello.com/b/YpRhWeeT/shared-content-calendar) in the "Dev.to" column assigned to you with the date you want to publish. 

On that day, publish your post by setting `published: true` in Dev.to. Then post to the #Community channel with the URL so GlitchDevs can tweet it out. 

## Giving Feedback/ Editing a post
For a helpful resources for editing posts see the "Writing tips", "Code Review", and "Publishing checklist" in the Appendix. 

## Appendix
### Code Review
Most Dev.to posts involve code in the form of:
- Embedded Glitch apps
- Code snippets in Markdown 

We do not have a strict code review process or standards, but we like to see:
- well-commented code
- a README.md in all Glitch apps
- files named in a way that will make sense I.E. "feedparser.js" rather than "file1.js"
- a license (MIT for now, more info TBD)

### Joining the Dev.to Glitch org 
To add posts to the Glitch org on Dev.to you'll need to join it. Sign up for the Dev.to account if you don't have one and DM Melissa on Slack to join. 

### Writing tips
- Introduction
  - a clear "what's this post about" thesis sentence that tells the reader what they'll learn if they read on. 
  - a link to Glitch
  - keep it short!
- Subheaders (H2s)
  - if it's a tutorial, these should be the steps, otherwise these should be the main points
  - first sentence under subhead should introduce the section, connect it to main thesis
  - we love links, make sure to link whenever possible
  - no sub subheads (like h3s, h4s)
- Conclusion
 - A good conclusion should "conclude" the "what's this post about sentence". For example if the "what's this post about" sentence is "Learning how to automate email can make your life easier" it should conclude with a sentence about how the post did make the reader's life easier. 
 - A CTA (call to action) sentence like "remix this and tweet us what you made"
 - Glitch boilerplate (see section in appendix)
