Ideas<sub>1</sub>: 
- Have you ever found a workaround for a common barrier or issue in a piece of open-source software you use? 
- How do you use Glitch?

## Writing your post

### Proposal
Create a Clubhouse story using the Dev.to template. Assign to Melissa. We'll work with you on topic and due date. 

### Outline
If you already have a process that works for you, go for it! Otherwise I strongly recommend writing a post outline and submitting it to Melissa for review. You can do this on the Clubhouse story. 

### Drafting
You're welcome to use whatever tools work for you. I strongly recommend using a tool like [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/), which encourages concise engaging writing. Make sure you follow the checklist in the Appendix.

Submit drafts as Markdown via pull request at [devto-posts](https://github.com/glitchdotcom/devto-posts). For example my post about Testing I would create a new file called test.md, add my post draft, and create a branch. Then submit a pull request for that branch to master. If you're new to GitHub, Melissa can help you with a personalized tutorial.

At this point don't worry about embeds, pictures or any other formatting.

After your draft is ready:
- add a comment to the Clubhouse card with a link to your draft
- assign to Melissa

### Automated feedback
When you submit a pull request on [devto-posts](https://github.com/glitchdotcom/devto-posts) you'll get some automated checks via GitHub Actions. You can see the results in the "checks" area of the Pull Request.
- [Vale](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale/) looks for common mistakes and gives some _optional_ writing advice. 
- [Link Checker](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/link-checker) visits the links in your post to make sure they work. 

### Feedback
For the feedback process we'll give you big picture pointers on the structure and content of your piece. We will not directly edit your piece at this stage. After preparing feedback the editor will reassign the Pull Request and story to you. When you incorporate the feedback, please reassign to Melissa for review. 

#### Technical Review 
The editor may add a reviewer for highly technical subjects if they are outside their experitise.

### Copyediting
At this stage, put your post into Dev.to in the Glitch org (see appendix) and add any formatting and code blocks you'd like. Assign back to the editor. 

We'll add UTM params to your links, and add images if you haven't. We'll also update the post in the [devto-posts](https://github.com/glitchdotcom/devto-posts) repo to make sure the link checker runs.  

### Ready to post!
Next we'll workshop Tweets and social media images. Feel free to leave this to us. When we publish we'll promote on our Dev Twitter and the homepage. 


## Appendix
### Joining the Dev.to Glitch org 
To add posts to the Glitch org on Dev.to you'll need to join it. Sign up for the Dev.to account if you don't have one and DM Melissa on Slack to join. 

### Writing checklist
- Introduction
  - a clear "what's this post about" sentence that tells the reader what they'll learn if they read on. 
  - a link to Glitch
  - keep it short!
- Subheaders (H2s)
  - if it's a tutorial, these should be the steps, otherwise these should be the main points
  - first sentence under subhead should introduce the section
  - we love links, make sure to link whenever possible
  - no sub subheads (like h3s, h4s)
- Conclusion
 - A CTA (call to action) sentence like "remix this and tweet us what you made"
 - Glitch boilerplate (see section in appendix)
 
 ### Glitch boilerplate
